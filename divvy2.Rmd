## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
load("InitRData.RDataTmp")
#write.csv(x = result_df, file = "divvy20_24.csv")
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
head(result_df)

result_df <- result_df  %>% mutate(start_date = as.Date(started_at)) %>% mutate(end_date = as.Date(ended_at))

data23_4 <- result_df %>% filter(started_at > as.Date("2022-01-01") & started_at < as.Date("2024-01-01"))

divvy24 <- result_df %>% filter( started_at >= as.Date("2024-01-01"))

library(data.table)
